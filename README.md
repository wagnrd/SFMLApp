A small framework for SFML.\
It allows you to easily create more complex GUIs and still let's you use the full SFML features. You can create your own capsulated views and simply let SFMLApp switch between them without you to have programm additional logic inside your views.

Currently w.i.p.
Look at [this project](https://github.com/wagnrd/Pong) for further usage references.
